# capd

Capability metadata lives here.

We keep this intentionally lightweight:
- A human-oriented README.
- A machine-readable descriptor (added later as the interface stabilizes).

The SourceOS build/orchestrator should be able to:
- discover capabilities
- validate versioning
- index contracts and schemas
